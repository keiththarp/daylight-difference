# Daylight Difference Determiner

## Calculate the difference in daylight time between two chosen locations.

 I built this app the winter of 2020/21 while hiding from COVID-19, tucked away in a quiet house in the woods near Acadia National Park.
 The super short winter days had me wondering how much sunlight we were missing out on compared to friends and family several hours to the south of us.

## How to use
1. Select a date or skip to default to today's date.
2. Search for a location.
3. Choose correct location.
4. Repeat 2 & 3.
5. Review results.

## Languages/Technologies
* React
* BootStrap
* TypeScript
* Axios
* Luxon

## APIs
* [OpenCage Geocoding](https://opencagedata.com/api) used to populate the location search and Lat/Long data.
* [Sunrise Sunset API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) Provides sunrise/set times, but conveniently enough also provides day length data, eliminating a math step.
